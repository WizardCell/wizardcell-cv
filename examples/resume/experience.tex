        \item {Made the game work from the \textbf{networking perspective}, while dealing with numerous aspects of the game that include but are not limited to:
          \begin{itemize}
            \item {\textbf{Matchmaking:}
              \begin{itemize}
                \item {Revamped our Invasion Matchmaking System while utilizing \textbf{Online Beacons}.}
                \item {Provisioned a Custom Matchmaking by Key System.}
                \item {Fixed our Ping Calculation System, ensuring clients are matchmade with good ping to the server.}
              \end{itemize}
            }
            \item {\textbf{Customization System:} Synchronized character customizations by \textbf{custom serialization \& compression} of data over the network to achieve atomic replication of data types unsupported by the Replication System.}
            \item {\textbf{Save/Serialization System:} Fixed vague game breaking issues that were caused by improper serialization of game state.}
            \item {\textbf{Gameplay Ability System:} Fixed several gameplay abilities not performing properly over the network, and made a few.}
            \item {\textbf{Character Movement \& Animation:} Various Game \& Engine level fixes to enhance the way characters move and animate.}
            \item {\textbf{Level Streaming:} Various Game \& Engine level fixes to ensure game state is synchronized and resilient against level streaming under harsh network conditions.}
            \item {\textbf{Level Design:} Implemented level design oriented tools to \textbf{enhance the workflow} of the level design team.}
            \item {\textbf{Audio:} Fixed countless audio bugs, where audio wasn't played properly across the network for all connections of interest.}
            \item {\textbf{UI:}
              \begin{itemize}
                \item {Fixed visually breaking issues with different in-game menus, and handled a bunch of memory leaks.}
                \item {Provisioned a dedicated, self-contained multiplayer settings menu.}
                \item {Provisioned user-facing text localization.}
              \end{itemize}
            }
          \end{itemize}
        }
        \item {Profiling and optimizing game's \textbf{network bandwidth} using \textbf{Networking Insights:}
        \begin{itemize}
          \item {Effectively identified and disabled replication on many Objects and properties that didn't need it.}
          \item {Effectively skipped data replication for connections that were able to conclude that data from elsewhere.}
          \item {Utilized \textbf{Oodle Network} plugin to manually compress serialized network data for improved player experience.}
          \item {Seamlessly moved bandwidth-unfriendly data to Objects that replicate less frequently, and persist longer.}
        \end{itemize}
        }
        \item {Profiling and optimizing game's \textbf{server CPU performance} usage using \textbf{Timing Insights}.}
        \item {Provisioned editor tools, that simplified and enhanced my workflow:
        \begin{itemize}
          \item {Made a simple editor tool that scans all our project's Blueprint assets, and inclusively finds potentially optimizable replicating Objects.}
          \item {Made a simple editor tool that triggers serialization on Blueprint assets, so that references to Gameplay Attributes can be seen in the reference viewer, to better understand how to optimize their owning Attribute Sets.}
        \end{itemize}
        }
