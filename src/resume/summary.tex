B.Sc. candidate in computer science with over 4 years of industry experience in software engineering, specializing in game development. I have a proven track record of delivering high-quality software solutions, particularly in network and gameplay programming. My strong background in Math and Physics, acquired through my degree, complements my technical skills.

My journey in game development began in 2016 with Unity, where I honed my foundational skills. In 2017, I transitioned to Unreal Engine and have been leveraging its capabilities ever since. My self-taught expertise in game development underscores my ability to quickly learn and adapt to new technologies and challenges. To date, two games I worked on were successfully released.
